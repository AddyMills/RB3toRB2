# RB3toRB2
![RB3toRB2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/C0Assassin/RB3toRB2/main/3to2.png)


Complete recreation of Rock Band 3's venues/animations/lipsyncing in Rock Band 2's midi/milo format. Disc songs only.

Venue lighting/cameras are recreated by hand and events are timed beat for beat.
When applicable, MOGGs are either recreated or use the actual RB3 moggs. Moggs are sometimes recreated so as to add some extras that weren't present in RB3 originally. (Custom crowd trackings.)


These are all in RPCS/PS3 format but the raw midi, moggs, and milos should all still work on 360. (Rename and remove .edat from the midi, change milo_ps3 to milo_xbox)
Everything else will have to be converted to Xbox format with a proper tool, like the album art.
(Eventually will add a 360 fork in the future.)

PS3 console requires encrypting edats and moggs, and that will have to be done manually unfortunately.
